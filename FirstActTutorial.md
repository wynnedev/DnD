# How to Plot the First Act

## Determine a Location

- Start with a overview of the current world
- Write an intro to the world and the act
- Determine what the BBEG is?
    -What does the BBEG want and what does he have to do to get it?
- Determine the inciting incident
    - Why should the players go down the path of adventure.

- Plan a series of initial encounters (Trail of Trials)
- The point of no return
    - at this point the story should feel personal
    - Tie it into their back stories
    - This first BBEG is dead but, there is a great threat to pursue

## Example

### Location

- A small village in the hinterlands
    - JB is here because his teacher was last seens here
    - Effie lives with a small conclave of elves in the hinterlands and is being harrassed by a thugs.
    - Kristy's character is the innkeeper at the local tavern the town is on the eve of a local festival and Kristy expects a big upturn in business but, recently one of her employees Islov requested to a sojourn into the wilderness to gather berries to make fresh wine.  He has yet to return.  Kristy noticed that the employee was spending a lot of time in the lauder before he made the request.  She considered it to be only slightly odd.
